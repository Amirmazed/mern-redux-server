# Mern stack website with redux
Here, I have built a simple ecommerce website with MERN stack. 
I have use MongoDb for the database, Express and Node for the backend and React, Redux for the frontend. 
This is a watch store where different categories of Rolex watches are available. 
The user can choose any watch he likes. He can view particular productâ€™s price, description, number available status. 
Then he can add to cart if he wants. He can also delete his order if he changes his mind. 
Total number of selected item is showed in the cart section. These whole process is done using React and Redux. 
I have deployed backend in Heroku and frontend in Netlify.
